# St. Clarence Montessori 
This website is for educational purposes only.
There are many different Montessori schoolâ€™s. They are all somewhat in competition with each other so the website has to explain why the school is the best. This website also takes the time to explain to parents what a Montessori school is in case they do not know. 
The website has a simplified interface so that parents/adults of any age are able to easily and effectively navigate to what they need.

## UX
This website is for parents that want their child to have a special type of education. Or for those who would like to donate to the organization.

## Features
The website has a about us page, prospective students page, contact page, and the home page which gives links to the academic calendar and the students page and the about us page.
The website is simple and easy to navigate. It is also responsive. 

## Features Left to Implement

1. A donation feature
- This feature was not added due to time and my knowledge. The reason why this feature is important is because there are many Montessori schools that are nonprofit and depend on donations to fund all of their needs. These funds are also used to provide scholarships to families that face financial hardship. This is important to include because I am a firm supporter of nonprofits and I want my website to represent something I firmly believe in so that maybe I can use this as an example and I can create a website such as this for a future nonprofit employer.
2. Social media icons
- I could not figure out how to get the sticky social icon element that I wanted to use to work. It would either look fine on web or fine on mobile but not on both. I'd rather have a site that works than adding elements that do not function correctly at this time.
3. Privacy policy/terms of service
- This element is important to me because I want this website to work as a nonprofit. So since I would be accepting donations I believe it would be wise to have links to these two pages.

## Technologies Used
1. [JQuery](https://www.jqueryscript.net/) 
- jquery was used with boostrap to make sure the navigation bar functioned correctly
2. [Boostrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) 
- boostrap was used for the navigation bar, section layout of the pages, and for the site responsiveness.
3. [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/) 
- css was used to stylize the site
4. [HTML](https://html.com/) 
-html was used to build the bones of the site

## Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.
Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:
Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.
You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.
If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
